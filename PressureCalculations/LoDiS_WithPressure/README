The Pressure calculation has almost entirely been taken from Riccardo Ferrando's Fortran code.

It can be found in the following files:
- force_rgl.f90 (where the calculation takes place, the pressure being computed from the force)
- module_cluster.f90 (where the pressure array is defined as an allocatable)
- the various output_*.f90 files (where the pressure is saved onto the movie.xyz files for all processes)


Finally, a boolean paramter has been included such as to be read in the input.in: the !output_pres variable. 
Set to True to save the pressure on the .xyz, and to False to only output the positions.
