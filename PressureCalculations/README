In this folder are to be found:

1) The fork of the LoDiS code to implement pressure calculations and output (using R. Ferrando's algorithm)

2) The post-processing codes written in Python, both as a script .py and an interactive Jupyter Notebook.
    They automatically read the movie.xyz and energy.out files produced by LoDiS, and generate a 3D pressure map,
    the distribution of pressure values through time, their radial distribution, and the total pressure evolution.
    More details in the respective codes.
    
3) Some examples of the post-processing results for:
    - Ag147 (Quenching)
    - Ag147 (Melting)
    - Ag316 (Quenching)
    - Ag316 (Melting)
    
4) a code for the estimate of surface atoms using the Spider algorithm
