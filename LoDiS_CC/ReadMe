This shall be the development directory for the LoDiS_CC (Classification and characteriation) programme.

The intention is for this to be a seperate, stand-alone code which can take the input of an xyz and energy file
created by LoDiS and generate information regarding the structure as a whole and each atom's local environment.

To use this, you must have installed in your python environment:

asap3
ase

{More to come as the code grows}



The "Descriptor_Draft" script is the one which is intended to be the user-interface script to be run

The idea being that a user will be able to manually input the parameters and directories they wish to work with
and decide on the fly which properties they would like analysed.



Ultimately, the goal is to use these decriptors of each atom and its environment to decide whether or not it exists
on the surface of the nanocluster and (maybe??) its propensity to be an adsorbate site.
