This is intended to be the main user interface module to be run
for the purposes of classifying and characterising nanostructures.
In theory, all of the sub-modules for this programme should be
found in the same directory and it should not matter from where
it is run. This is because the user will define the absolute path 
to their raw data and even the file names (and possible relative path).
