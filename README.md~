## Background
The LoDiS package is a semi-empirical classical molecular dynamics software to investigate processes for finite-size systems
between 10-10000 atoms. Incorporated tools allow for investigations into growth/coalescence, quenching, phase transition, 
free energy and metadynamics with or without the presence of an MgO substrate. 

Supported nanosystems include:
* Mono- and bi-metallic clusters (metal-metal interactions are modelled by the Rosato-Guillope-Legrande potential) [1]
* Noble gases (Lennard-Jones potential) [2]
* Carbon-based systems (Pacheco-Girifalco potential) [3]

LoDiS allows for two choices of coordination number calculations; either by Fermi distribution formalistaion [3] or 
via analytical and polynomial formalisation [4].

## Installation
Clone the repository into a local directory:
```
https://github.com/kcl-tscm/LoDiS.git
```

Open the Makefile and select the correct version of fortran (listed under gfortran/ifort) and its libraries on your local computer by removing the necessary '#' symbols.

Compile all the .f90 files by running the Makefile:
```
cd LoDiS/LODIS_GIT
make -f Makefile
```

## Usage
Copy the **input.in** file into a chosen output directory.
The input variables for an MD simulation, including which type of process is to be simulated, are determined by modifying the **input.in** file.
Supporting annotations within the file provide information on each variable. 

Other files required for simulation include:  
* .xyz file with the initial nanocluster atom postions 
* .pot file with the potential parameters
* .pot file with the MgO substrate parameters (only when MgO substrate is present)
* .xyz file with coalescence cluster postions(only during coalescence/growth)

List the files to be read by the sofware in the **input.in** with either the relative path or ideally the absolute path.
Example files for reference are provided in the **example_input_files** directory.

To run the simulation, use the following command line in terminal:
```
./PATH/LODIS_all <input.in> output.out
```
/PATH is the relative path from the **input.in** file directory (i.e the current directory) to the LoDiS_GIT directory.
Upon initializing the simulation, LoDiS will run in the background till completion.

## Example
A rapid 100K/ns melting simulation of an Ag 147 atom iscosahedron is readily available with the use of the provided files in the **example_input_files** directory.

The chosen melting rate is determined by the variable relation:
```
deltat/(npas*tstep)
```

**Generally tstep shouldn't be changed unless required**

Edit the paths to the for Ag147.xyz and Ag_Ag.pot files before running the simulation:
```
filepos      = '~/Documents/LoDiS/input_example_files/Ag147.xyz',             ! Initial atom positions file, ONLY .xyz format
  
filepot      = '~/Documents/LoDiS/input_example_files/Ag_Ag.pot',             ! Potential parameters file, ONLY .pot format
```

NOTE: PT38TO.xyz nor Ag_Ag.MgO.pot are not used in this particular run.

Running the simulation will output the following six files:
* energy.out
* movie.xyz
* error.out
* definition.out
* pr.out
* output.out

The caloric and trajectory data are written into the energy.out and movie.xyz files respectively.
